        <p>The most important components of most parrots' diets are seeds, nuts, fruit, buds, and other plant material.<br>
            A few species sometimes eat animals and carrion, while the lories and lorikeets are specialised for feeding on floral nectar and soft fruits.<br>
            Almost all parrots nest in tree hollows (or nest boxes in captivity), and lay white eggs from which hatch altricial (helpless) young.</p>
